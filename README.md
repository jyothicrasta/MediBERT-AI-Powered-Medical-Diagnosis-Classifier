# MediBERT-AI-Powered-Medical-Diagnosis-Classifier
MediBERT is a machine learning project designed to classify medical diagnoses with high accuracy by leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project uses DistilBERT for extracting meaningful features from unstructured textual medical reports and fine-tunes a BERT-based model for robust classification.

Features
Keyword Extraction: Extracts key medical terms from textual reports using DistilBERT.
Efficient Classification: Classifies medical diagnoses with high accuracy using a fine-tuned BERT model.
Interactive Interface: A user-friendly dashboard built with Streamlit for demonstration and testing.
