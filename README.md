# MediBERT - AI Powered Medical Diagnosis Classifier

MediBERT is an AI-driven medical diagnosis classification system that leverages deep learning and NLP techniques to classify medical diagnoses from textual reports with high accuracy.  
The project uses **DistilBERT** for extracting meaningful features from unstructured medical text and fine-tunes a **BERT-based model** for robust classification.  
This system enhances **medical decision support** through automated text classification.



## Features
- **Keyword Extraction**: Extracts key medical terms from textual reports using DistilBERT.  
- **BERT-based Classification**: Utilizes a fine-tuned BERT model for medical diagnosis classification.  
- **High Accuracy**: Supports efficient and reliable medical text classification.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit.  
- **Scalable Implementation**: Efficient and adaptable for large-scale medical data analysis.  


##  Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **NLP Models**: DistilBERT (feature extraction), BERT (classification)  
- **Libraries**: Transformers, Scikit-learn, Pandas, PyTorch, Joblib  
- **Deployment & UI**: Streamlit
